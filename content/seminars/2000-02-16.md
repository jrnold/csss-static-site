Developmental theories of antisocial behavior commonly distinguish between early and late onset delinquency. This presentation will describe a generalization of my prior work on a group-based, semi-parametric method for trajectory estimation that allows for the joint estimation of trajectories of distinct but related behaviors. The generalized method will be applied to longitudinal data on childhood physical aggression as measured by teacher reports and adolescent violent delinquency as measured by self- reports. The purpose is to test whether and to what extent there is late onset violent delinquency.
