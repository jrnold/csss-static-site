Here are two problems arguably faced by those hoping to generalize about the determinants of policy change in Congress and other legislatures: First, what is the unit of analysis? Researchers often write of long-term changes in support for a &quot;policy,&quot; but what Congress actually considers are bills, and bills die at the end of each two-year congress. Second, if we think of Congress considering a population of policy proposals, how does the researcher draw a sample to study? These questions have not been seriously addressed by social scientists. Possible answers will be suggested, with comments and other proposals welcomed.
