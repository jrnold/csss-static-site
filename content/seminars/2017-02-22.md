The theoretical foundations of lifespan development are situated in thinking about long-term change over years and decades - and are typically examined using growth models. Social exchange and individual behavior, however, are enacted in the day-to-day and minute-to-minute and examined using models of intraindividual variability. Can these two paradigms be integrated? Drawing on empirical illustrations, we try out a set of ideas about how new technologies may afford observation of ZOOTS - ZOOms, Tensions, and Switches - and support development of multiple time-scale models of behavior.
