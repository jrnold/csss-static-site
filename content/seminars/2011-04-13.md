Previous sociological research on infidelity has pointed to strong gender differences in lifetime infidelity that vary by an individualâ€™s age, but this research has confounded age, period, and cohort (APC) effects, making it impossible to know how these factors uniquely contribute to infidelity rates. Using a recently developed hierarchical Bayesian APC model and the General Social Survey (1991-2010), the present study is the first to examine age, period, and cohort associations with infidelity and how they vary by gender. Results show strong gender differences across birth-cohorts, with age as an important correlate for men only, not women, as was purported in previous research. Period effects revealed an overall increase of 4-5% in rates of infidelity during the 19 years of the study period. Statistical and methodological challenges in applying the APC model to infidelity will also be highlighted.
