How are academic institutions and disciplines adapting to the demands of an increasingly data-intensive science?  Data science is imagined as one solution, but what data science is and what it will look like against the backdrop of traditional academic institutions is currently in flux. Data science in academia is very much still in the making. As part of the Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments I collaborate with a group of ethnographers who are studying these transformations. Drawing on over two years of ethnographic fieldwork within the UW Data Science Environment, I discuss some of the evolving conceptual, epistemological, and cultural trends across the data science communities. This includes the sensemaking about data science through different metaphors; the emerging practices of knowledge production across fields; and the cultural work of the term “hack” across the data science environments.
