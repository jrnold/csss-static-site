This study was motivated by a debate in the Czech Republic on the requirement to report Cronbach’s alpha, a measure of reliability, for all higher education admissions tests. Cronbach’s alpha is a widely used estimator for assessing reliability (i.e. reproducibility under replicate conditions) of multi-item scales. One of its limitations is that it assumes a single underlying construct behind all items. Cronbach’s alpha also assumes that the item responses are continuous and therefore using it with scales of binary items is questionable. 

In this talk, I present work on the development of a new estimator of reliability appropriate for scales of binary items. I present a simulation study to compare the new estimator, *logistic alpha*, with Cronbach’s alpha and other existing estimators of reliability. I discuss the findings in the context of the real data from admission tests used in the Czech Republic.
