In this talk, I focus on two types of geolocated data: individual GPS traces and cell phone records. I present key features of these datasets, mobility measures as well as spatial modeling approaches. Two datasets collected in the United States and Rwanda are used for illustration. I also discuss the practical relevance of massive geolocated data in the context of HIV research. Joint work with Matt Dunbar, Tim Thomas and Nathalie Williams.
