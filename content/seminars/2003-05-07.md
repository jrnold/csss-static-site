Motivated by an example concerning marijuana use of US teenagers, I will describe the use of dependence ratios to model the association between repeated multinomial responses. I will review work with Anders Ekholm (Helsinki) and John McDonald (Southampton) for repeated binary responses, before considering work with Jukka Jokinen (Helsinki) on an extension to the multinomial case.
