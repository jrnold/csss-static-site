Instrumental variable (IV) methods are widely used in economics for estimating regression models where the right hand side variables are correlated with the error terms. Such correlation arises in a number of circumstances: simultaneous equation models, the use of proxy variables, and omitted regressors being common examples. In this tutorial, I compare ordinary least squares (OLS) and IV methods. Comparison of the distribution of the OLS and IV estimators will be intuitive rather than formal. I then give several empirical examples from the econometric literature to illustrate how to find and use instruments.
