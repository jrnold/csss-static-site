This paper takes a fresh look into Africa's dismal growth performance by using the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) methodology. We estimate the posterior probability of a large number of potential explanatory variables and cross-country regression models. In large, we find that determinants of growth in Africa are strikingly different from the rest of the world. In addition, growth regression models that best explain global growth do poorly in explaining African growth, and conversely.
