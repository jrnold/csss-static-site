In this talk, I will show some recent work developing and implementing modern psychometric models to neuropsychological testing data used in studies of the elderly, and show results from several genetic analyses of phenotypes derived from these models. I will discuss two applications: resilience and dysexecutive late onset Alzheimer's disease. The audience should come away with some appreciation of the use of modern psychometric analyses to make greatest use of neuropsychological data, and some of the genetic analyses facilitated by recent and forthcoming large investments in enotyping and sequencing people from studies focusing on late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
