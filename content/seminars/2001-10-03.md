In a bloodless uprising against the statistical establishment of the 1940-1960's, economists have developed a language for causation -- structural equation models (SEM). Today, this language serves as a basic modeling tool in econometrics and the social and behavioral sciences, though it is still a mystery to statisticians and a semi-mystery to its practitioners. In this talk, I will show how the SEM language, enriched with a few concepts from logic and graph theory, offers a powerful conceptual and mathematical framework for managing difficult nonlinear problems in causal and counterfactual analysis. I will survey three such problems: (1) the identification of policy effects, (2) the assessment of causal attributions in specific scenarios, and (3) the separation and assessment of direct and indirect effects.
