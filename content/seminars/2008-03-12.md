I will discuss some of our recent work in dynamic modelling for multivariate time series and sparsity modelling in matrix data analysis. This includes dynamic matrix-variate graphical modelling for portfolio investment management in financial time series, with examples drawn from individual/personal (i.e., &quot;you and me&quot;)-level mutual fund studies as well as the more typical institutional/investment bank-oriented exchange rate studies. Central topics include questions of graphical model uncertainty and search, and the decision-level implications of sparse model structuring. Similar concerns arise in problems of modelling matrix data - i.e., contexts in which each single observation is a matrix - and I will discuss some of our recent work with novel graphical models and some examples in macro-economic time series as well as novel Markov random field models of potential interest in spatial and imaging problems.
