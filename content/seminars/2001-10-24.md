Statistics began its emergence 200 years ago to meet needs of science and government, and has enjoyed considerable success in guiding a wide range of quantitative studies for over 100 years. Why, then, is it not considered part of everyone's basic education? Why is it still among the most despised of undergraduate college courses? Why has its use not become epidemic in business, industry, and government? Is progress being made to remedy these situations? The answer to the last question is a qualified &quot;yes,&quot; but the lessons of the past must be taken to heart if statistics is to move to the forefront of quantitative education and scientific practice. Opportunities abound, however, and the future could be bright!
