Built environment (BE) and health research has focused on characteristics of home neighborhoods, whereas overall environmental exposures occur over larger spatial ranges. In this talk we introduce SmartMaps which provide measures of local BE characteristics for a large set of GPS locations. Empirically we found that for most subjects, home and non-home BE exposures differed significantly. Our results suggest that considering the full range of individualsâ€™ environmental exposures may improve the understanding of effects of BE on behavior and health outcomes.
