Substance abuse treatment has been evaluated for some time, with both pharmacological and behavioral interventions showing promise and/or efficacy. The national Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) has recently funded a national, multisite Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) in which these efficacious interventions are to be put into practice in community based treatment programs with a wide range of approaches and clients to test their effectiveness.

The presentation will review the evolution of the development of the CTN, discuss some of the current and anticipated protocols to be tested, and discuss some of the general statistical issues and specific challenges for the CTN site here at the University of Washington.
