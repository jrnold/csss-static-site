In March 2005, Seattle P-I reporter Phuong Cat Le approached the UW statistical consulting service, for help in determining whether Washington's 'Pay-Day' loan businesses target blacks and the military. 

The short answer: they do. 

This talk will trace the long answer, walking through the phases of data analysis, modeling and causal analysis. 

I hope to provide and receive insight on at least the following three topics: 
- Statistical modeling of social datasets 
- Tackling questions of causality in social statistical research 
- The broader social implications of this particular phenomenon. 

The words &quot;New Orleans&quot; might be mentioned. 

I will be grateful if you prepare to contribute to the discussion by reading the two-part P-I article (Google &quot;Phuong Le Payday&quot; and &quot;Phuong Le Payday soldier&quot;), and browsing my consulting report ( http://www.stat.washington.edu/assaf/WashPayDay.pdf). At least the P-I articles make a good reading.
