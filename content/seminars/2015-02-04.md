High resolution data from global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometry are able to record the locations where physical activity occurred. Along with travel diaries and geographic information system (GIS) data, behavioral and contextual characteristics can be associated with these locations. This talk will present measurement and data storage methods, and briefly touch on examples of applied research.
