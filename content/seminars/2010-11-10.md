Statistical testing has a long history of controversy; the Fisher and Neyman-Pearson approaches have fundamental differences, and neither of them agree with standard Bayesian procedures. In this talk, we set out an approach to testing that dissipates some of this controversy. Using decision theory, we develop tests as trade-offs, where the user balances potential inaccuracy of a point estimate against the `embarrassment' of making no scientific conclusion at all. The resulting Bayesian tests are simple, and their repeated-sampling properties can be determined straightforwardly. We also consider extensions, to set-valued decisions and to inference which is robust (or at least ‘agnostic’) to model specification.

Material in this talk is joint work with Adam Szpiro and Thomas Lumley. The talk is intended to be accessible to all graduate students and faculty.
