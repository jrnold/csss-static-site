A usual assumption in survival analysis, hazards analysis, and event history analysis is that each subject is at risk of experiencing a “failure” (the event of interest).For some processes, this assumption is unrealistic—that is, some subjects are immune to failure.This primer examines statistical methods for relaxing the assumption, so that some subjects are immortal with respect to the failure process.Immortality (a.k.a. sterility, immunity, “cure fraction,” etc.) is treated a latent characteristic of subjects who are right censored. The resulting mixture model can be used to estimate covariate effects on the duration process, probability of immortality, as well as the effect of covariates on the probability of immortality.We also examine special cases where information on a subset of right-censored subjects identifies them as either immortal or susceptible to failure.The methods are applied to data on recidivism, fecundability, and tooth eruption.
