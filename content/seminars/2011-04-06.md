For many years, political scientists have developed and applied various kinds of multi-dimensional scaling to the study, particularly, of roll call voting in Congress.Seemingly regardless of technique, the results are regularly interpreted as demonstrating that congressional voting is “one and half dimensional,” that is, dominated by a single dimension (interpreted as “left –right”) with sometimes the intrusion of a second dimension (about half the time at less than half the apparent “importance” of the first dimension).

I ask two questions in this presentation, reporting on work done in two papers with Jacob Montgomery (one paper) and David Sparks (both papers).One seeks to study public evaluations of politics and political elites in terms similar to the study of Congress.While some of the first scaling papers in the discipline looked at public opinion, that study has waned, and we seek to reopen that inquiry.We find that the public also can be characterized in similar dimensional terms, with the dominant dimension being either partisan or ideological (or both), the second tending to distinguish competitive and electoral politics from the rest of politics.We find a clearer pattern of perceptions of emerging polarization at the elite level than, perhaps, even the huge literature of elite polarization suggest.

The second paper asks whether the observation of one and a half dimensions in scaling is consistent with the conclusion that the political world being subjected to multi-dimensional scaling is actually one and a half dimensional.We show that this conclusion is not warranted and that, while it is true that observing estimates of one dimension might reflect the data being drawn from a unidimensional world, it is also and equally consistent with the data being generated from a, say, 434 dimensional world.We also show that even the slightest of partisan bias in congressional roll call voting makes it all but certain that scaling will yield one or one and a half dimensions.
