Measuring the size of a population is an old statistical problem but methods for multiple lists or samples have taken on a new focus in the past decade, allowing for dependence among lists and heterogeneity. This talk presents an overview of the emerging toolkit of methods, both Bayesian and frequentist, that have found application in diverse areas. Examples in this presentation will include: the population of the US (sampling and the census), the number of Italians with diabetes, and the size of the World Wide Web.
