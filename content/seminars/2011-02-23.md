The detection of areas in which the risk of a particular disease is significantly elevated, leading to an excess of cases, is an important enterprise in spatial epidemiology. A number of frequentist approaches have been suggested for the detection of clusters, based on a hypothesis testing framework. Unfortunately, these suffer from a number of drawbacks including the difficulty in specifying a p-value threshold at which to call significance, the inherent multiplicity problem, and the possibility of multiple clusters. In this talk I will describe a Bayesian approach in which the study region is partitioned into, possibly multiple, ``zones'' within which the risk is either at a null, or non-null, level. Computation is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo, tuned to the cluster model. The method is applied to leukemia data in Upstate New York State, and Washington SEER data.
