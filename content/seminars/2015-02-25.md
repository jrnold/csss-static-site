This presentation describes research conducted on online rumoring after the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombings. Through qualitative and visual analysis, we offer in-depth descriptions of four rumors: their origins, changes over time, and relationships between different types of rumoring behavior. We identify several quantitative measures—including temporal progression, domain diversity, lexical diversity and geolocation features—that constitute a multi-dimensional *signature* for each rumor, and provide evidence supporting the existence of different rumor types. These signatures enhance our understanding of how different kinds of rumors propagate online during crisis events. In constructing these signatures, this research demonstrates and documents an emerging method for deeply and recursively integrating qualitative and quantitative methods for analysis of social media trace data. The preliminary research is part of a larger effort aimed at developing automated techniques for detecting and classifying rumors propagating through Twitter.
