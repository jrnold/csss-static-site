The first part of this talk consists of an overview of an ongoing project on the determinants of birthweight and other pregnancy outcomes. In this project, the presenter and colleagues will use a unique data file to address several interesting hypotheses about (among other things) the influence of socioeconomic factors on pregnancy outcomes. The second part of this talk presents an overview of the impact of measurement error on estimated coefficients in regression models. The final part of this talk describes the ways in which conclusions about the impact of parents' education on infants' birthweight are changed by considering measurement error in the parents' education variables.
