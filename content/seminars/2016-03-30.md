There are five main schools of thought in machine
learning, and each has its own master algorithm â€“ a general-purpose
learner that can in principle be applied to any domain. The symbolists
have inverse deduction, the connectionists have backpropagation, the
evolutionaries have genetic programming, the Bayesians have
probabilistic inference, and the analogizers have support vector
machines. What we really need, however, is a single algorithm
combining the key features of all of them. In this talk I will
summarize the five paradigms and describe my work toward unifying
them, including in particular Markov logic networks. I will conclude
by speculating on the new applications that a universal learner will
enable, and how society will change as a result.
