Intellectual Ventures Laboratory is developing epidemiological models to assist in planning campaigns against malaria, polio, HIV, and TB. This seminar will focus on our recent HIV modeling work, which uses individual-based stochastic modeling to study the spread of HIV under various assumptions about the contact network and pharmacological interventions. We will describe and compare algorithms for simulating and evaluating assumptions about dynamic networks that evolve in response to demographic changes. We will also touch on other computational and scientific aspects of the model. Computational aspects include architecture, high-performance computing, and techniques for searching high-dimensional parameter spaces. Scientific aspects include dynamic evolution of host immunology, disease progression, and drug pharmacology.
