The ongoing evolution of the Web poses challenges for social scientists they seek to develop methodological approaches permitting robust examination of Web phenomena that evolve over time. Increasingly complex Web applications that are altering traditional relationships between media form and content challenge the adaptation of traditional approaches to social research on the Web. Web-based media require new methods of data collection and storage, and new strategies for analyzing form and content, along with processes and patterns of production, distribution, usage, and interpretation. Foot will demonstrate tools and methods developed by the research group she co-directs, WebArchivist.org
