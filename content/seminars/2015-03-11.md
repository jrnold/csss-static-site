There is a great deal of empirical evidence about the impact of teacher quality on student achievement. But relatively little is known about the quality of the tools districts use to screen and hire teacher applicants. This project explores the efficacy of the selection tools used by Spokane Public Schools (SPS) when making teacher hiring decisions. We find the SPS screening rubrics predict teacher value-added in student learning and teacher attrition. In this presentation we look closely at the consistency of multiple ratings and explore the possibility of increasing the predictive power of selection tools through increasing inter-rater and intra-rater reliability.
