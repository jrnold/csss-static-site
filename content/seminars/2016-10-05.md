Bayesian item response models have been used in modelling Internet ratings data.  The statistical analysis carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods may not be computationally feasible when real-time parameter estimation is needed. We develop an efficient algorithm based on a deterministic moment-matching method to adjust the parameters in real-time. The proposed online algorithm works well for two real datasets, achieving good accuracy but with considerably less computational time.
