For nearly a century, social theorists have recognized that behavior is a function of two quite different factors: values - that is, individual's relative evaluations of the attractiveness of their available courses of action, and the constraints that these individuals face in their environment. However, attempts to measure values have often come up short. This study will compare the predictive reliability of a new measurement strategy, based on factorial survey techniques, to the traditional strategy, based on surveys in which respondents are directly questioned. Unlike the traditional measurement strategy, the factorial approach entails substantial statistical modeling.
