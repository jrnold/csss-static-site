In the past several years, there have been exciting additions to the
toolkit for statisticians and data analysts who work in R. Examples
include RStudio, the R markdown format for dynamic reports, the Shiny
web application framework, and improved integration with Git(Hub). The
downside, of course, is the potential agony associated with mastering
new tools and developing new workflows. Change is hard. I will give an
overview of these developments and describe the costs and benefits
associated with adopting new approaches to data exploration and
analysis. There will be an emphasis on the use of version control
in data analysis (vs. software development).
