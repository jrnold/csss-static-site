The talk begins with a brief introduction to the principles and practice of multiple imputation. It then proceeds to consider several issues of considerable practical importance: maximum likelihood vs. multiple imputation, imputation of categorical variables via linear models, sequential models vs. comprehensive models, and congeniality of imputation model and analysis model.
