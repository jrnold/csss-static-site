In 2011 and at the request of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the National Research Council and the Committee on National Statistics appointed a panel to explore approaches to estimate the number of illegal entries at the US-Mexico border, between ports of entry. At the time, the number of apprehensions of undocumented migrants at the southwestern border of the US had decreased tremendously relative to earlier years. This decline coincided with a period of dramatic increases in enforcement efforts at the border by DHS. But apprehension trends by themselves do not indicate that the stepped-up programs at the border were successful. To understand the effectiveness of anti-immigration measures we also need to know how many individuals attempted to cross into the US without authorization. With this in mind, the NRC panel was asked to review survey and modeling options, or a combination of both, that might permit estimating the number of border crossing attempts per quarter and per sector. In this talk, I first describe the process of unauthorized immigration and then discuss the panelâ€™s methods, findings and recommendations.
