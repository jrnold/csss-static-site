Dr. Heidi Hartmann founded IWPR in 1987 to meet the need for women-centered, policy-oriented research. She holds a B.A. in Economics from Swarthmore College and M.Phil and Ph.D. degrees in Economics from Yale University. In 1994, she was the recipient of a MacArthur fellowship award. Commonly referred to as the &quot;genius grant,&quot; this fellowship was awarded to recognize her pioneering work in the field of women and economics. At IWPR, Dr. Hartmann has co-authored several reports including Unnecessary Losses: Costs to Americans of the Lack of Family and Medical Leave; Who Needs a Family Wage?: The Implications of Low-Wage Work for Family Well-Being; Women's Access to Health Insurance, Combining Work and Welfare: An Alternative Anti-Poverty Strategy and The Impact of Social Security Reform on Women. Before founding IWPR, she taught at Rutgers University and the New School for Social Research and worked at the National Academy of Sciences and the US Commission on Civil Rights. Dr. Hartmann is originally from Toms River, New Jersey.
