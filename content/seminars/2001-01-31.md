This paper examines the linkages between household choices of housing and job location, vehicle ownership, and activity and travel patterns to develop a behavioral framework for integrating land use and transportation models. It assesses the interdependence of these choices, the processes used to represent them, and alternative methodological frameworks to represent them in an operational model system.
