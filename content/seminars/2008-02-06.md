The study deals with ways to incorporate information at the disposal of individuals in evaluating the effect of public intervention programs. Data on trainees' self assessments (SAV) regarding the contribution of vocational training were used to establish the value and uniqueness of this source of information. Furthermore, the study reveals that individuals engage in a continuous process of learning and updating information. This is a crucial factor that needs to be taken into account in considering SAV as a reliable source of data. Matching seems to be the most natural method to incorporate SAV in the evaluation process.
