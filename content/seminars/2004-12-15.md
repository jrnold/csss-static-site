Tens of thousands of individuals undergo polygraph security screening examinations in the U.S. every year. How good is the polygraph in detecting deception in such settings? Is there a scientific underpinning for the detection of deception? Are there suitable alternatives to the polygraph for security screening? Two years ago, the NAS-NRC Committee to Review the Scientific Evidence on the Polygraph released it's report, &quot;The Polygraph and Lie Detection,&quot; addressing these issues. Professor Fienberg chaired this committee and will talk about the answers to these questions and how they illustrate the nexus of science, policy, and myth.
