In a series of popular books, Edward Tufte urges data analysts to rely on information-rich, carefully designed visual displays to convey their findings. Yet social scientists still rely on (often difficult to interpret) tables to present complex, often non-linear statistical models, and, given the effort and specialized skills required, seldom imitate or better Tufte's widely admired graphics. I will present a suite of tools for R which make it much easier to produce customizable, readable, publication ready graphics directly from the output of a large family of regression models. I will discuss their use in clarifying the substantive implications of regression models, as well as the pedagogical benefits of integrating these tools into courses on quantitative inference.
