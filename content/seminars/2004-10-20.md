Digraph panel data (directed edges between vertices observed at two or more time points) arise in the social sciences and other fields of scientific inquiry. A popular approach to model such data is to embed the discrete observations of the digraph into an unobserved, continuous-time Markov process. A large and appealing family of Markov probability models was considered by Snijders (2001). A substantial disadvantage associated with the mentioned family is the assumption that the vertices have identical weights in relevant digraph functions, which may be a doubtful assumption.
