This talk provides an overview of robust statistics. I begin by providing a brief review of the main data-oriented and theoretical concepts as introduced by the “founding fathers” J. W. Tukey, P. J. Huber and F. R. Hampel, along with their favorite estimators. Then we describe the evolution of robust regression theory and methods, from least-absolute deviations to methods focused on minimizing maximum bias due to outliers with and without a constraint on normal distribution efficiency. I describe what I consider to be the current robust regression method of choice due to V. Yohai and colleagues. Several finance applications of robust regression will be given in the context of single-factor and multi-factor models using the robust library implemented in S-PLUS and R. In the remainder of the talk I briefly discuss some aspects of robust covariance and correlation matrix estimation, including alternative outlier models and stochastic versus deterministic computational methods.
