      Since 1960s, statisticians have started realizing the importance of
      characterizing the role of parameter dimension in statistical inference.
      For this, pioneers like Peter Huber started introducing a new feature
      into asymptotics: the number of parameters, $p$, is now allowed to increase
      with the sample size $n$. Following this track of thinking, in 1980--90's,
      statisticians like Stephen Portnoy and Enno Mammen developed a set of
      seminal results, sharply characterizing the limiting behaviors of
      regression estimators and exploring the growth rate boundary of $p$ with
      regard to $n$. More recent results, aiming at tackling more general
      statistical problems, include He and Shao (2000) and Spokoiny (2012). In
      this talk, I will give a systematic review of these results, as well as
      disclose more new features. In particular, simple criterion will be given
      for guaranteeing asymptotic normality for general problems under the
      boundary condition $p ^ 2 / n \to 0 $. The proof rests on Talagrand
      generic chaining for empirical processes. Smoothness will be shown, as
      always, to play the key role in analysis.

      Age-period-cohort (**APC**) models are commonly used to analyze and project
      mortality or morbidity rates, in which effects related to the age of an
      individual, calendar time (period) and the generation (cohort) can
      reasonably be assumed to be present. Bayesian approaches facilitate
      estimation and improve predictions by assigning smoothing priors to age,
      period and cohort effects. A quirk of APC models is, however, the obvious
      linear dependence of age, period and cohort effects leading to a
      well-known identifiability problem. When rates are further stratified,
      for example, by gender or countries, multivariate APC models can be used,
      where differences of stratum-specific effects are identifiable and
      interpretable as log relative risks. In this talk I will introduce the
      univariate APC model and illustrate the inherent identifiability problem
      before I will demonstrate the use of multivariate Bayesian APC models and
      challenges when extending to a spatio-temporal context.
