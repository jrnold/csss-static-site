Scientific progress depends on the evaluation of findings through replication. While exact replication of results is often infeasible because of limitations of time and resources, a minimal standard of reproducibility is emerging as a norm of practice in contemporary computational and biological sciences. This standard refers to authors making available the data and code used to generate the key figures and tables of their publications. In this presentation, I review some approaches to reproducible research that have been emerging in the social sciences. I describe some widely used tools, barriers to their adoption, and suggest how we might foster reproducibility in the social sciences.
