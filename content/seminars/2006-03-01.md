Research in international politics may have produced misleading results because (1) typical data contain dependencies that have been ignored, (2) populations are treated as samples, with unwarranted reliance on misleading significance tests, and (3) scant attention is devoted to how well the model can predict the events of interest. Using the democratic peace research program as an example, we show that the three elements of the Kantian model-mutual democracy, high trade and common membership in IGOsâ€“have at best weak effects on dampening the occurrence of militarized international disputes within dyads. Neither do they offer meaningful predictions about which dyads will be involved in these disputes. A model incorporating several types of dependencies among countries yields results with high levels of predictive accuracy and provides new substantive insight about the prominence of dependencies in international relations.
