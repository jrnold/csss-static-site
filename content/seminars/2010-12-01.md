We propose network-based statistical models for learning about groups which are difficult to reach using standard surveys, such as the homeless or individuals with HIV/AIDS. Rather than sampling directly, we reach these individuals through their social network using questions on standard surveys. Specifically, we use questions of the form &quot;How many X's do you know?,'' where X represents the population of interest, and present two statistical models for inferring unobserved features. Our first model, akin to a block model in complete network literature, leverages known information about respondents and some common populations (people named Michael, for example) to estimate demographic profiles and population sizes in hard-to-reach populations. We next propose a latent space model where the propensity for an individual to know members of a given group is independent, given the positions of the individual and the group in a latent &quot;social space.&quot; This framework is similar in spirit to latent space models for complete networks (Hoff 2005). We then estimate relative homogeneity of hard-to-reach groups and describe variation in the propensity for interaction between respondents and population members. We also demonstrate how our method can be used for network inference outside of hard-to-reach populations, making information about more complicated network structure available to the multitude of researchers who cannot practically or financially collect data from the entire network.
